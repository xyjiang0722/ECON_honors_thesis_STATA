## Topic: The Robustness to Misspecification of Various Estimators of Average Treatment Effects  
I assume the pseudo-true models p^⋆ (X), μ_1^⋆ (X), and μ_0^⋆ (X) only differ from the true models by an omitted vector of controls, q(X). Take the empirical example in Kline’s study (2010) as the starting point. The dependent variable is RE78 (earnings in 1978), and the independent variables include a treatment indicator (1 if treated, 0 if not treated), age, education, Black (1 if black, 0 otherwise), Hispanic (1 if Hispanic, 0 otherwise), married (1 if married, 0 otherwise), no degree (1 if no degree, 0 otherwise), RE74 (earnings in 1974), RE75 (earnings in 1975). Assume the independent variables in the misspecified model contain the above variables plus a squared term of age. Also assume the omitted variables are squared terms of all other continuous variables, a cubic term of age, and interactions of all the original variables.
